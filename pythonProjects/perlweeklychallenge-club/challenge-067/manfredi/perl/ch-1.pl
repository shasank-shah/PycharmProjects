# Task #1
# You are given two integers $m and $n.
# Write a script print all possible combinations of $n numbers from the list 1 2 3 â€¦ $m.
# Every combination should be sorted i.e. [2,3] is valid combination but [3,2] is not.
# Example:
# Input: $m = 5, $n = 2
# Output: [ [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5] ]

use strict;
use Algorithm::Combinatorics qw(combinations);

my $m = 5;
my $n = 2;

# my $m = 4;
# my $n = 3;

my @c = combinations( [1..$m], $n);
print "@$_\n" for @c;
