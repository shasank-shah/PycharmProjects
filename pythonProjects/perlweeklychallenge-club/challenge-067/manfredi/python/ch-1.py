# Task #1
# You are given two integers $m and $n.
# Write a script print all possible combinations of $n numbers from the list 1 2 3 â€¦ $m.
# Every combination should be sorted i.e. [2,3] is valid combination but [3,2] is not.
# Example:
# Input: $m = 5, $n = 2
# Output: [ [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5] ]

from itertools import combinations

m = 5
n = 2

# m = 4
# n = 3

output = [ x for x in combinations(range(1, m + 1), n) ]
print(output)
