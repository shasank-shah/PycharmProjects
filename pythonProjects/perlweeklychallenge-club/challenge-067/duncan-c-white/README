Task 1: "Number Combinations

You are given two integers $m and $n. Write a script print all possible
combinations of $n numbers from the list 1 2 3 ... $m.

Every combination should be sorted i.e. [2,3] is a valid combination but
[3,2] is not.

Example:

Input: $m = 5, $n = 2

Output: [ [1,2], [1,3], [1,4], [1,5], [2,3], [2,4], [2,5], [3,4], [3,5], [4,5] ]
"

My notes: generally I hate permutation questions, but this looks ok.


Task 2: "Letter Phone

You are given a digit string $S. Write a script to print all possible letter combinations that the given digit string could represent.

(1 represents _ or @,
2 A,B or C,
3 D,E or F,
4 G, H or I,
5 J, K or L,
6 M, M or O,
7 P, Q, R or S,
8 T, U or V,
9 W, X, Y or Z
letters from a phone panel)

Example:

  Input: $S = '35'

  Output: ["dj", "dk", "dl", "ej", "ek", "el", "fj", "fk", "fl"].

My notes: sounds pretty easy.  Lookup the set of possibilities for each
letter, then cross-product them.
