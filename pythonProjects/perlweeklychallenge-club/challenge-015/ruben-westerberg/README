Encode and decode with Vigen√®re cipher. Ascii leters (upper and lower case), space, and sample pucctuation characters are supported.
Operation  is performed on a line by line basis from standard input and printed to standard output

To encode:
	ch-2.pl KEY
		where KEY is the key to encode with. Input data is read from stdin
To decode:
	ch-2.pl -d KEY
		where KEY is the key used for encoding. Input data is read from stdin

Loopback test:
	./ch-2.pl "my key" | ./ch-2.pl -d "my key"
