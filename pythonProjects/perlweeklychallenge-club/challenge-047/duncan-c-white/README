Task 1: "Roman Calculator

Write a script that accepts two roman numbers and operation. It should
then perform the operation on the give roman numbers and print the result.

For example,

perl ch-1.pl V + VI

should print

XI
"

My notes: cute, especially given that we did Roman->Int and Int->Roman in
challenge 10:-).  So convert Roman->Int, Do Op, Int->Roman for the result.
Added the ability for the user to specify the operands in EITHER Roman
or Arabic.

Task #2: "Gapful Numbers

Write a script to print first 20 Gapful Numbers greater than or equal
to 100.  See https://oeis.org/A108343 for details.
In summary, Gapful Numbers are those numbers >= 100 that are divisible
by the number formed by their first and last digit.  Numbers up to 100
trivially have this property and are excluded.  eg. 100 is, because 100%10==0
"

My notes: cute.  Easy.  Was so easy that I did it in Postscript as well.
