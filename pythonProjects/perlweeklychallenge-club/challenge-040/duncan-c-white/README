Task 1: "Show multiple arrays content:

You are given two or more arrays. Write a script to display values of
each list at a given index.

For example:
Array 1: [ I L O V E Y O U ]
Array 2: [ 2 4 0 3 2 0 1 9 ]
Array 3: [ ! ? £ $ % ^ & * ]

We expect the following output:

I 2 !
L 4 ?
O 0 £
V 3 $
E 2 %
Y 0 ^
O 1 &
U 9 *
"

My notes: trivial.  Each array on command line as a word, i.e. array elements
are single characters?  Allow any number of arrays (arguments) >= 2.
Also handle the case where the arrays are not necessarily of the same length,
by displaying '?' for any element off the end of an array.


Task 2: "Sort SubList

You are given a list of numbers and set of indices belong to the
list. Write a script to sort the values belongs to the indices.

For example:

List: [ 10, 4, 1, 8, 12, 3 ]
Indices: 0,2,5

We would sort the values at indices 0, 2 and 5 i.e. 10, 1 and 3.

Final List would look like below:
List: [ 1, 4, 3, 8, 12, 10 ]
"

My notes: looks very easy. I guess the decision is: sort in place, or
extract items via an array slice, sort them, then update those items
in the original array (via another array slice?) The latter sounds
much the easier, so let's do that:-).
