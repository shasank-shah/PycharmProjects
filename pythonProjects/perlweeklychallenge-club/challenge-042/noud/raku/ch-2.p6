# Balanced Brackets
#
# Write a script to generate a string with random number of ( and ) brackets.
# Then make the script validate the string if it has balanced brackets.
#
# For example:
# () - OK
# (()) - OK
# )( - NOT OK
# ())() - NOT OK

    # given -1. If the count ever goes below zero there are more close
    # brackets than open brackets, hence an unbalanced string. If at the end
    # the count is more than zero there are more open brackets than close
    # brackets, hence an unbalanced string.
