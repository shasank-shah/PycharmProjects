Task 1: "3 Sum

Given an array @L of integers, and a target T. Write a script to find
all unique triplets such that a + b + c is same as the target T. Also
make sure a <= b <= c.

Example:

    @L = (-25, -10, -7, -3, 2, 4, 8, 10);

One such triplet for target 0 i.e. -10 + 2 + 8 = 0.
"

My notes: Fine.


Task #2: "Colourful Number

Write a script to display all Colorful Number with 3 digits.

    A Colorful Number is an integer where all the products of consecutive
    subsets of digit are different.

For example, 263 is a Colorful Number since 2, 6, 3, 2x6, 6x3, 2x6x3 are unique.
"

My notes: Interesting.

Having written this, assuming that it's correct, I find 328 Colourful 3-digit
numbers.
