Challenge 1: "Write a script that computes the equal point in the Fahrenheit and Celsius scales, knowing that the freezing point of water is 32 Â°F and 0 Â°C, and that the boiling point of water is 212 Â°F and 100 Â,"

My notes: Isn't that just Maths?  solve F = 9/5C + 32 for F==C?

C = 9/5C + 32 => 4/5C = -32 => C = 5/4 x -32 = 5 x -8 = -40

But if I have to "compute" something that I should obviously "solve by
algebra", could I do some sort of "where do two lines intersect" solver?
Let's have a go.


Challenge 2: "Write a script to create an Indentity Matrix for the given
size. For example, if the size is 4, then create Identity Matrix 4x4."

My notes:

Surely that's incredibly straight forward.  The identity matrix has 1s
on the leading diagonal and 0s everywhere else.  But should we create
it in memory as a 2-D array and print that out, or just print out the
identity matrix?  Let's choose the latter as it's simpler and more direct,
even though the former approach would be more useful in real life, as
presumably this is going to be one operation in a more general Matrix
class/module [really, these questions need to be BETTER SPECIFIED to
clarify this sort of thing]
