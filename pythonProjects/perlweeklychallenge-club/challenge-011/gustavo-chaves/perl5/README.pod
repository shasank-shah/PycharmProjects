=over 4

Write a script that computes the equal point in the Fahrenheit and Celsius
scales, knowing that the freezing point of water is 32 째F and 0 째C, and that the
boiling point of water is 212 째F and 100 째C. This challenge was proposed by
B<Laurent Rosenfeld>.

It's not clear what the script is supposed to do. After all, with a little
algebra we can calculate the solution by hand. For a while I thought about
writing the following script:

  #!/usr/bin/env perl
  print "40\n";

But, since the purpose of the challenge is to allow us to learn something I
searched CPAN for a Math module that could help me solve a system of linear
equations. I ended up using the L<Math::MatrixReal> module which seems cool.

=head1 #2 Identity Matrix

=over 4

Write a script to create an Indentity Matrix for the given size. For example, if
the size is 4, then create Identity Matrix 4x4. For more information about
Indentity Matrix, please read the
L<wiki|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_matrix> page.

This one was easier. I wrote two scripts. The first one simply builds a
two-dimensional array representing the matrix and prints it with the
L<Data::Dump> module. The only real interest in it is how the array is
constructed using the 'x' and the '..' operators to make it terse.

The second solution is even simpler using the L<Math::MatrixReal> module's
C<new_diag> constructor. Go figure!
