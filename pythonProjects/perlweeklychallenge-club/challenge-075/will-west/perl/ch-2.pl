#TASK #2 â€º Largest Rectangle Histogram
#Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
#You are given an array of positive numbers @A.
#
#Write a script to find the largest rectangle histogram created by the given array.


#my solution takes advantage of the fact that a chart like what we're working with never has vertical gaps. So, we just need to find contiguous horizontal lines and square them with the distance from the chart's base.

#I promise to try to do proper testing for the next one!


my @chart = getchart();
my @rows = makerowsfromchart(@chart);
my @contiguous = contiguousinrows(@rows);
my @squares = square(@contiguous);

      }
