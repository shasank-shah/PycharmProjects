# You are given a file containing a list of words (case insensitive 1 word per line)

# letters from the list. You can use each letter only once (though there can be duplicates and you can use each of them once),
# you donâ€™t have to use all the letters. (Disclaimer: The challenge was proposed by Scimon Proctor)
