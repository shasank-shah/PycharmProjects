# Olympic Rings
# There are 5 rings in the Olympic Logo as shown below.
# They are color coded as in Blue, Black, Red, Yellow and Green.
#
# We have allocated some numbers to these rings as below:
#
# Blue: 8
# Yellow: 7
# Green: 5
# Red: 9
# The Black ring is empty currently.
# You are given the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6.
# Write a script to place these numbers in the rings so that
# the sum of numbers in each ring is exactly 11.
