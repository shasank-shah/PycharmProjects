Challenge 1: "Write a script to display months from the year 1900 to 2019 where you find 5 weekends i.e. 5 Friday, 5 Saturday and 5 Sunday."

My notes:

Clearly defined, although Friday isn't normally considered part of the weekend
is it?  Anyway, it's clear here that Friday - Sunday is the weekend for the
purposes of this question.  Date::Manip can do this easily enough.


Challenge 2: "Write a script that can wrap the given paragraph at a specified
column using the greedy algorithm."

My notes: Another clearly described problem.  Greedy algorithm wiki page
just neans: fit words on the line while they fit:-)
