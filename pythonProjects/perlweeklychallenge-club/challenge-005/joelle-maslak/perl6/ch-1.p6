# If you want to use /usr/share/dict/words as the word list, you can
# omit the filename.

# Example:
#
#   perl6 ch-1.p6 binary
#
# which is equivilent to:
#
#   perl6 ch-1.p6 binary /usr/share/dict/words
#
# With my Unix dictionary (English), it returns binary and brainy

# Yes, this is a VERY tiny modification of Week 4 problem 2.
