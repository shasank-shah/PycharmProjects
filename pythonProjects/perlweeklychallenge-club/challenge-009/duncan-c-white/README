Challenge 1: "Create a script which takes a list of numbers from
command line and print the same in the compact form. For example, if
you pass 1,2,3,4,9,10,14,15,16 then it should print the compact form
like 1-4,9,10,14-16.."

Quite simple and dull problem. But ok, let's have a go.

Challenge 2: "Create a script to calculate Ramanujan's constant with at
least 32 digits of precision."

Never heard of this constant, seems to be e^(pi*sqrt(163)), which is
"very nearly an integer", I don't particularly care about abtruse mathematical
formulae.  But ok, Perl's built in module biggrat will let you do this anyway,
specifying accuracy 32; see ch-2.sh for the oneliner.
