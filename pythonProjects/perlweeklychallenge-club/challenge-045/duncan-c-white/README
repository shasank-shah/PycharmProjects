Task 1: "Square Secret Code:

The square secret code mechanism first removes any space from the original
message. Then it lays down the message in a row of 8 columns. The coded
message is then obtained by reading down the columns going left to right.

For example, the message is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".

Then the message would be laid out as below:

thequick
brownfox
jumpsove
rthelazy
dog

The code message would be as below:

tbjrd hruto eomhg qwpe unsl ifoa covz kxey

Write a script that accepts a message from command line and prints the
equivalent coded message.
"

My notes: sounds trivial, let's write the decoder as well.

Task #2: "Source Dumper:

Write a script that dumps its own source code. For example, say, the script name is ch-2.pl then the following command should returns nothing.

$ perl ch-2.pl | diff - ch-2.pl
"

My notes: trivial if we're allowed to use $0.
