# Write a script to demonstrate Mutually Recursive methods. Two methods
# are mutually recursive if the first method calls the second and the
# second calls first in turn. Using the mutually recursive methods,
# generate Hofstadter Female and Male sequences.
#
# F ( 0 ) = 1   ;   M ( 0 ) = 0
# F ( n ) = n âˆ’ M ( F ( n âˆ’ 1 ) ) , n > 0
# M ( n ) = n âˆ’ F ( M ( n âˆ’ 1 ) ) , n > 0.
