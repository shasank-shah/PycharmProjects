# Challenge #1

The numbers formed by adding one to the products of the smallest
primes are called the Euclid Numbers (see wiki). Write a script that
finds the smallest Euclid Number that is not prime.

## Solution

Calculate the product of prime numbers and check if each successor is a prime.

# Challenge #2

Write a script that finds the common directory path, given a
collection of paths and directory separator. For example, if the
following paths are supplied.

```
/a/b/c/d
/a/b/cd
/a/b/cc
/a/b/c/d/e
```

and the path separator is `/`. Your script should return `/a/b` as common
directory path.

## Solution

```
perl -- ch-2.pl <*delimiter*> <*list of strings*>
```

The path *delimiter* is a string like `/`.
The *list of strings* is a string like `/usr/bin:/usr/sbin`.

The solution is to find the consecutive intersection of all paths.

# Challenge #3

Find out the synonyms of a given word using the Synonyms API.
