ch-1.pl and ch-1.raku
===================
kth Permutation sequence
Run the program with two commandline arguments (n and k) to generate the permutation of n integers. Program will display the kth permutation.
Validity of input is also checked with k required to be less then the number of permutations possible for the value n
With no inputs the value of n=3 and k=4 are used



ch-2.pl and ch-2.raku
===================
Demonstrates the longest 20 Collatz Sequences for staring numbers 1..n. n is specified on the comand line. Otherwise 23 is used by default.
