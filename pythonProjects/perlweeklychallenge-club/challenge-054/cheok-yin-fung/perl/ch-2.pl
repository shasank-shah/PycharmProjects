# Perl Weekly Challenge #054 Task 2

# Normal Usage: ch-2.pl [TARGET]
# It returns the Collatz sequence beginning with the target number.

# For the display of the sequence length from 1 to 1000000: 
# Usage: ch-2.pl
# it creates a file "ch-2_logfile" saving the seqence length.

# For the extra credit (the 20 numbers which have the largest seq length):
# I wanna write a selection algorithm (trying a binary heap) for getting 
# the extra credit seq length), but I have no time, ooops

# those codes did not follow "YAGNI" rule - ambitious but "unoptimized",
# hence my laptop suffered for 40 hrs)
