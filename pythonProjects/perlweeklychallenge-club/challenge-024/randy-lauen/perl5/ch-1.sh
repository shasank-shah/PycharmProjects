# Task:
# Create a smallest script in terms of size that on execution doesn’t throw any error.
# The script doesn’t have to do anything special. You could even come up with smallest one-liner.

# Notes:
# An empty string would work and be even shorter, but I'll go with a non-zero
# script, with an emphasis on not doing anything special.
