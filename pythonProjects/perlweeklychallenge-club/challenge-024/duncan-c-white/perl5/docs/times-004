And so to the logic. It's possible to believe (as I don't) that Brexit
could lead us to glory: but only after a "clean" exit from the EU
and the ties that come with membership. And it's possible to believe
(as I do) that we are wiser to remain. But to believe we could benefit
from being half-in, half-out defies logic. The ties of membership,
or half-membership, are what real Leavers believe hold us back. Real
Remainers, meanwhile, share their horror at subjecting ourselves to
rules we've lost the right to shape. The illogic of compromise that
delivers the worst of both worlds would defeat Gabriel, defeated Mrs May,
and will defeat whoever succeeds her.
