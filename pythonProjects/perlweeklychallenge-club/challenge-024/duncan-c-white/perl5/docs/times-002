The Archangel Gabriel couldn't have delivered Mrs May's famous
"Brexit that works for everyone" promise. It will become fashionable
in columns like these to identify things she could have done to get
her deal through, and the time (always yesterday) when she could have
done them. And I can believe that with Mr Gove's persuasiveness or Mr
Johnson's amiable bombast, a different prime minister might just have
pushed something like her deal over the line.
