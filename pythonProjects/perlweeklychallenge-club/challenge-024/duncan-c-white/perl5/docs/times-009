Be clear: whoever takes over will soon enough need to be very, very
bold, one way or the other. Would-be Tory leaders will shortly be wooing
supporters with a promise to "go back to Brussels" for a better deal,
threatening no-deal Brexit if they don't. Whoever wins will then have
to try. They'll return empty-handed. What then? Here's Mr Johnson,
speaking in Switzerland today: "We will leave the EU on October 31,
deal or no deal ... The way to get a good deal is to prepare for a no
deal. To get things done you need to be prepared to walk away."
