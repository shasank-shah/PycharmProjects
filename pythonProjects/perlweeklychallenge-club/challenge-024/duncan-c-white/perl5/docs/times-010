This week the Institute for Government published an important report,
suggesting that a PM intent on a no-deal Brexit could thwart parliament by
a lightning decision to do it without MPs' say-so. Be warned, would-be
prime ministers: this would be nuclear, a coup against representative
democracy and a breach of our unwritten constitution. This way, infamy
lies. Gangrene would follow such an amputation. Don't even think
about it.

That leaves a referendum, a revocation, a general election, or all
three. Theresa May's departing tears are unlikely to be the last shed
at Downing Street's door.
