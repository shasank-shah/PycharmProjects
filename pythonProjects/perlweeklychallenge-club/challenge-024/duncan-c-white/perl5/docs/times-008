The man's a rascal. But like many rascals he's capable of a big
decision. It's possible to imagine him telling the country that this
Brexit business has got into such a poisonous muddle that we need to rip
it up and start again: to revoke Article 50, or refer back to the people,
or both. He might escape with his life. A Hunt, a Gove, a Hancock or a
Javid wouldn't.
