# Task #2
# Create a script to implement full text search functionality using Inverted Index. According to wikipedia:
# In computer science, an inverted index (also referred to as a postings file or inverted file)
# is a database index storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a table,
# or in a document or a set of documents (named in contrast to a forward index, which maps from documents to content).
# The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full-text searches, at a cost of increased processing
# when a document is added to the database.
# Here is a nice example of Inverted Index.
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_indexing#Inverted_indices
