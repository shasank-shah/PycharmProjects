In Milwaukee it is snowing
on the golden statue 
of the 1970s television star
whose television house
was in Milwaukee 

and also on the Comet Cafe
and on the white museum 
the famous Spanish architect 
built with a glass 

elevator through it
and a room with a button
that when you press it
makes two wings

on the sides of the building 
more quickly than you might 
imagine mechanically 
rise like a clumsy

thoughtful bird 
thinking now
I am at last ready 
over the lake

that has many moods
to fly but it will not
and people ask
who are we who see 

so much evil and try 
to stop it and fail 
and know we are no longer 
for no reason worrying 

the terrible governors 
are evil or maybe 
just mistaken and nothing 
can stop them not even 

the workers who keep 
working even when 
it snows on their heads
and on the bridge 

that keeps our cars 
above the water 
for an hour 
in northern California 
today it snowed 

and something
happened people 
turned their beautiful 
sparkling angry faces up
