The End of a much-applauded Speech.--The Presentation of Dr. Samuel
Ferguson.--Excelsior.--Full-length Portrait of the Doctor.--A Fatalist
convinced.--A Dinner at the Travellers’ Club.--Several Toasts for the
Occasion.

There was a large audience assembled on the 14th of January, 1862, at
the session of the Royal Geographical Society, No. 3 Waterloo
Place, London. The president, Sir Francis M----, made an important
communication to his colleagues, in an address that was frequently
interrupted by applause.

This rare specimen of eloquence terminated with the following sonorous
phrases bubbling over with patriotism:

“England has always marched at the head of nations” (for, the reader
will observe, the nations always march at the head of each other), “by
the intrepidity of her explorers in the line of geographical discovery.”
 (General assent). “Dr. Samuel Ferguson, one of her most glorious sons,
will not reflect discredit on his origin.” (“No, indeed!” from all parts
of the hall.)

“This attempt, should it succeed” (“It will succeed!”), “will complete
and link together the notions, as yet disjointed, which the world
entertains of African cartology” (vehement applause); “and, should it
fail, it will, at least, remain on record as one of the most daring
conceptions of human genius!” (Tremendous cheering.)

“Huzza! huzza!” shouted the immense audience, completely electrified by
these inspiring words.
