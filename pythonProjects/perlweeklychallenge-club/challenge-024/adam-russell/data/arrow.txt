On a certain afternoon, in the late springtime, the bell upon Tunstall
Moat House was heard ringing at an unaccustomed hour.  Far and near, in
the forest and in the fields along the river, people began to desert
their labours and hurry towards the sound; and in Tunstall hamlet a group
of poor country-folk stood wondering at the summons.

Tunstall hamlet at that period, in the reign of old King Henry VI., wore
much the same appearance as it wears to-day.  A score or so of houses,
heavily framed with oak, stood scattered in a long green valley ascending
from the river.  At the foot, the road crossed a bridge, and mounting on
the other side, disappeared into the fringes of the forest on its way to
the Moat House, and further forth to Holywood Abbey.  Half-way up the
village, the church stood among yews.  On every side the slopes were
crowned and the view bounded by the green elms and greening oak-trees of
the forest.
