Challenge 1 and 2 contained in ch1.pl and ch1.p6 files.
Output is a histogram listing of repeated values. Numeric values and a graph are output

Usage examples:
	ch-1_and_2.p6 INPUTFILE
	ch-1_and_2.pl  INPUT FILE

	ch-1_and_2.p6 -vsort INPUTFILE
	ch-1_and_2.pl -v INPUTFILE

-v/-vsort will sort the entries by count value not key value
