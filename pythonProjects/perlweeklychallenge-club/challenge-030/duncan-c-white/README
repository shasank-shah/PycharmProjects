Challenge 1: "Write a script to list dates for Sunday Christmas between
	      2019 and 2100. For example, 25 Dec 2022 is Sunday."

My notes: Very well defined, another job for Date::Manip or Date::Simple..


Challenge 2: "Write a script to print all possible series of 3 positive
	      numbers, where in each series at least one of the number is even and
	      sum of the three numbers is always 12. For example, 3,4,5."

My notes: Well defined, looks straightforward by brute forcish search (with
the third number in the sequence being fixed as 12-first-second of course,
so only two degrees of freedom).
