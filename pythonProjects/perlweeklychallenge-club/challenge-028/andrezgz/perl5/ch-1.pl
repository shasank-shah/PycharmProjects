# Task #1
# Write a script to check the file content without actually reading the content.
# It should accept file name with path as command line argument and
# print "The file content is binary." or else "The file content is ascii." accordingly.

use strict;
use warnings;

die "Usage: $0 <filename>" unless @ARGV == 1;

my $file = shift;
die "'$file' is not a file" unless (-f $file );

# Maybe I'm cheating here because, being precise,
# the -T/-B test "reads" the first bytes of the file and then makes an educated guess

print 'The file content is ascii.' if -T $file;
print 'The file content is binary.' if -B $file;

./ch-1.pl ch-1.pl
The file content is ascii.
