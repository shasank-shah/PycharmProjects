Challenge 1: "Write a script to check the file content without explicitly
reading the content. It should accept file name with path as command
line argument and print 'The file content is binary.' or else 'The file
content is ascii.' accordingly."

My notes: That's bafflingly unclear!  Without "explicitly" reading
the content, does that imply "implicitly" reading it is ok, or that
we're really not supposed to read the content at all.  In the former
case, I guess we can run "file" and parse the outout.  In the latter
case, unless there's some magic metadata somewhere else, that only
leaves file extensions.  In that case, we just need a hash of file
extension -> binary/ascii choices. Dull.  


Challenge 2: "Write a script to display Digital Clock. Feel free to be
as creative as you can when displaying digits. We expect bare minimum
something like '14:10:11'"

My notes: Sounds like a job for Tk:-)
