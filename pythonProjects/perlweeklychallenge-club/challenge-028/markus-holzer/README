Solution #1 requires the external command `file`
For Windows that program is available at

http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/file.htm

To make the clock tick on Windows, solution #2 requires a module
I wrote which is not on CPAN yet: Win::VT (Name is likely to change).
The module enables the terminal emulation in the "DOS" prompt.

To run the script you need to say

> chcp 65001
> perl6 -MWin::VT::Auto::O ch-2.pl6 --at=2,2

I included the module. It is not to be considered part of the challenge.
