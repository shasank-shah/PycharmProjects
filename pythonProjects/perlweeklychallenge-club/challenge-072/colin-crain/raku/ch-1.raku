#         TASK #1 â€º Trailing Zeroes
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a positive integer $N (<= 10).
# 
#         Write a script to print number of trailing zeroes in $N!.
# 
#         Example 1
#         Input: $N = 10
#         Output: 2 as $N! = 3628800 has 2 trailing zeroes
# 
#         Example 2
#         Input: $N = 7
#         Output: 1 as $N! = 5040 has 1 trailing zero
# 
#         Example 3
#         Input: $N = 4
#         Output: 0 as $N! = 24 has 0 trailing zero
