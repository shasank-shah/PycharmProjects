#         TASK #2 â€º Lines Range
#         Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#         You are given a text file name $file and range $A - $B where $A <= $B.
# 
#         Write a script to display lines range $A and $B in the given file.
# 
#         Example
#         Input:
#             $ cat input.txt
#             L1
#             L2
#             L3
#             L4
#             ...
#             ...
#             ...
#             ...
#             L100
#         $A = 4 and $B = 12
#         Output:
#             L4
#             L5
#             L6
#             L7
#             L8
#             L9
#             L10
#             L11
#             L12

#       notes:
#
#         never actually having had call to use the flip-flop
#         operator to parse line numbers, I had to look up the
#         syntax ($. "Current line number for the last filehandle
#         accessed."). On the PerlMonk site I found a
#         clarification by our own Choroba. So with that guidance
#         I carried on. Credit where credit due; thanks for the
#         tip.
# 
#         Unless by some coincidence there are *two* Perlesque
#         Chorobas out there, an E. Choroba and a just plain
#         Choroba. I mean, it is quite likely there are more than
#         one, after all. That might be cause for worry as they
#         might meet up and attempt to take over the world. We'll
#         have to watch for that.
