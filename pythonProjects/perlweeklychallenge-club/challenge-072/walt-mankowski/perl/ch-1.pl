# TASK #1 â€º Trailing Zeroes
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given a positive integer $N (<= 10).
#
# Write a script to print number of trailing zeroes in $N!.
# Example 1
# Input: $N = 10
# Output: 2 as $N! = 3628800 has 2 trailing zeroes
#
# Example 2
# Input: $N = 7
# Output: 1 as $N! = 5040 has 1 trailing zero
#
# Example 3
# Input: $N = 4
# Output: 0 as $N! = 24 has 0 trailing zero
