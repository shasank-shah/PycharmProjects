# This program finds the intersection of two lines.  While the word
# "ends" is used, I'm instead assuming that these are true mathematical
# lines, not line segments, so the intersection point may not be between
# the two points that define the line.
#
# The first thing we need to do is to find the slope of each line.
#
# Edge case 1: If either line is not fully defined, we return an error.
# This happens if both points are the same.
#
# Edge case 2: A vertical line can't be defined by the standard y = A × x₁ + C
# equation.  In this case we handle it differently, see below.  We use ∞
# for the slope in this case.
#
# To find the slope (of non-vertical lines), it's just rise / run, which is
# easy to calculate.  For the constant, we need to solve this:
#  y = Ax + C
# A given point will define x and y, while the slope defines A, so we just
# solve for C.  THus:
#  C = y - Ax;
#
# If we have two equations: y₁ = A₁ × x₁ + C₁
#                           y₂ = A₂ × x₂ + C₂
#
# We can find the intersection:
#   1) If slope is identical, and constants differ, NO INTERSECTION
#   2) If slope is identical, and constants are the same, this is the
#      same line.
#   3) If the slope is infinite of either line, just solve the other
#      equation to determine y for that value of x.
#   4) Otherwise, we're looking for the point where x₁=x₂ and y₁=y₂
#      Thus, we can rewrite the equations as:
#       y = A₁ × x + C₁
#       y = A₂ × x + C₂
#      We can solve this system for x:
#       A₁ × x + C₁ = A₂ × x + C₂
#      Rewritten:
#       A₁ × x - A₂ × x = C₂ - C₁ 
#      Rewritten:
#       (A₁ - A₂) × x = C₂ - C₁ 
#       x = (C₂ - C₁) ÷ (A₁ - A₂) 
#      Once we have x, we can solve for y by plugging into either of the
#      original equations.
