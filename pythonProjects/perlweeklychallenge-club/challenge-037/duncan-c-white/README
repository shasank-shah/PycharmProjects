Challenge 1: "Write a script to calculate the total number of weekdays (Mon-Fri) in each month of the year 2019.
Jan: 23 days
Feb: 20 days
Mar: 21 days
Apr: 22 days
May: 23 days
Jun: 20 days
Jul: 23 days
Aug: 22 days
Sep: 21 days
Oct: 23 days
Nov: 21 days
Dec: 22 days
"

My notes: sounds rather straightforward, with or without date manipulation
modules.  Might even have a crack at this in an unconventional language
as well as Perl - how about Adobe Postscript?

Afternotes: I did 3 versions of this:

ch-1-Date-Manip.pl: first version uses Date::Manip's Date_DaysInMonth(m,y) and
		    Date_DayOfWeek(m,d,y) functions.

ch-1.pl:	    second version does it ourselves from scratch.

ch-1-in-postscript.ps: translated ch-1.pl into Postscript.  Yes, the language
		       mostly used for printer page layout, can be used as a
		       full-blown programming language.  However, you have to
		       include functions to append strings and produce a
		       variety of debugging messages down the page, before
		       you start on the actual program logic.


Challenge 2: "Write a script to find out the DayLight gain/loss in
the month of December 2019 as compared to November 2019 in the city of
London. You can find out London sunrise and sunset data for November 2019 here:
https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/uk/london?month=11&year=2019

and for December 2019 here:
https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/uk/london?month=12&year=2019
"

My notes: most of this problem is fetching the web pages and parsing the
information out of the first table in each page: that's a typical
HTML::Parser state machine, easy enough.  But once we have that information,
eg. for each month a day->daylight duration mapping, what exactly does the
question mean us to do?  

I think this problem means

"calculate the difference between the amount of daylight on 1st Nov and on
30th Nov, do the same for December (1st and 31st), and find out which
"within month daylight duration" is smaller."

btw, if I'm right the smaller duration is obviously between 1st-31st Dec
than between 1st-30th Nov, because in November the days are getting shorter
throughout the whole month, whereas in December they get shorter from
1st-21st Dec, and then get longer again!
