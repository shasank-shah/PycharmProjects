# Pythagoras Pie Puzzle, proposed by Jo Christian Oterhals.

# At a party a pie is to be shared by 100 guest. The first guest gets 1% of the
# pie, the second guest gets 2% of the remaining pie, the third gets 3% of the
# remaining pie, the fourth gets 4% and so on.

# Write a script that figures out which guest gets the largest piece of pie.
