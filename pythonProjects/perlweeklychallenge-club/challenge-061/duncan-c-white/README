Task 1: "Product SubArray

Given a list of 4 or more numbers, write a script to find the contiguous
sublist that has the maximum product. The length of the sublist is
irrelevant; your job is to maximize the product.

Example

Input: [ 2, 5, -1, 3 ]

Output: [ 2, 5 ] which gives maximum product 10.
"

My notes: very straightforward.


Task 2: "IPv4 Partition

You are given a string containing only digits (0..9). The string should
have between 4 and 12 digits.

Write a script to print every possible valid IPv4 address that can be
made by partitioning the input string.

For the purpose of this challenge, a valid IPv4 address consists of four
'octets' i.e. A, B, C and D, separated by dots (.).

Each octet must be between 0 and 255, and must not have any leading
zeroes. (e.g., 0 is OK, but 01 is not.)

Example

Input: 25525511135,

Output:

255.255.11.135
255.255.111.35
"

My notes: sounds quite straightforward, nice problem.
