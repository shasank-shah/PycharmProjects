#        TASK #2
#         Word Game
#             Lets assume we have tiles as listed below, with an alphabet (A..Z)
#             printed on them. Each tile has a value, e.g. A (1 point), B (4
#             points) etc. You are allowed to draw 7 tiles from the lot
#             randomly. Then try to form a word using the 7 tiles with maximum
#             points altogether. You donâ€™t have to use all the 7 tiles to make a
#             word. You should try to use as many tiles as possible to get the
#             maximum points.
#
#             For example, A (x8) means there are 8 tiles with letter A.
#
#                 1 point
#                 A (x8), G (x3), I (x5), S (x7), U (x5), X (x2), Z (x5)
#
#                 2 points
#                 E (x9), J (x3), L (x3), R (x3), V (x3), Y (x5)
#
#                 3 points
#                 F (x3), D (x3), P (x5), W (x5)
#
#                 4 points
#                 B (x5), N (x4)
#
#                 5 points
#                 T (x5), O (x3), H (x3), M (x4), C (x4)
#
#                 10 points
#                 K (x2), Q (x2)
#
#         method: so many parts to this puzzle. The three basic structures
#             are to:

#                 1. select a hand,
#                 2. determine every possible combination of letters from that hand,
#
#             then for each of these combinations,

#                 3. determine whether it is a valid word, and its point score,
#                     while keeping track of the highest point score. It's a new
#                     high score, zero out the previous talley and begin anew.
#
#             To select a hand, I found it easier to explicitly parse the
#             configuration stated above and use that to construct a data
#             structure to hold it, loading the constructed perl code using eval.
#             Beats typing it out and and errors will be structural rather than
#             lexical. Once we have the configuration we can use that to construct
#             a bag of numbered tiles 0-108 with letters for values. We draw from
#             this to build a hand of 7 tiles, with duplicate draws "thrown back"
#             and redrawn until we have 7 unique numbered tiles. To finish we
#             construct an array by mapping the tile numbers to their respective
#             letter values.
#
#             To determine letter combinations we will look to a the
#             Algorithm::Permute module, which, given a list and a length,
#             impliments nPr permutations, outputting a rearranged list for each
#             one. To gauge the scope of this task I wrote a function to calculate
#             the sum of the number of permutations of 7 tiles into 7 letter
#             words, plus the permutations of 6 letter words, 5 letter, etc. That
#             number grows large quickly as the number of chits grows, but for 7
#             is only 13699 permutations, quite managable. That routine is
#             included here, with an auxillary factorial function, but not used
#             for this script. 13699 permutations is managable, and I considered
#             writing my own, but the Algorithm::Permute module is written in XS,
#             so is very fast.
#
#             By joining a permutation list into a string we can then compare it
#             to a list of words and see if we find a match. NLP and verifying
#             words as valid English would be very, very cool but a little more
#             than a week's work I'd imagine. Perhaps there's a module for that,
#             but I don't know it. So word lists it is.
#
#             For possible words, most *NIX systems have a /usr/share/dict/words
#             dictionary file somewhere. I found this a bit lacking in plurals, so
#             found a Scrabble Dictionary txtfile, pulled it down and used that.
#             Seeing as our game is quite similar to yet legally distinct from
#             Scrabble(tm), this is better as it will list, as I understand, all
#             legal words, with separate entries for conjugations and declensions.
#             Perusing this list makes it clear why I will probably never be a
#             top-field Scrabble player. Then again, I would consider it a
#             personal victory to ever find a way to use the word cwtch in a
#             sentence. If it's good enough for those maniacs, it's good enough
#             for me.
#
#             To get a point value for the word, should the lookup match, we can
#             use the config hash again to translate to the point values from the
#             list returned by the permute iterator and sum that. The iterator
#             doesn't care about duplicate words if the initial set has duplicate
#             letters, for example CATSAXZ will make the word CATS twice, once
#             from each A. So the current list of best words is kept in a hash,
#             with a single key per word. Every time the highest value is
#             exceeded, the hash is restarted with the new best word.
#
#         results: For amusement, I broke off the 7 tile hand size into a
#             configuration variable. As we can see from running our perviously
#             mentioned permute_sum routine,
#                 tiles:  3           15 permutations
#                 tiles:  4           64 permutations
#                 tiles:  5          325 permutations
#                 tiles:  6         1956 permutations
#                 tiles:  7        13699 permutations
#                 tiles:  8       109600 permutations
#                 tiles:  9       986409 permutations
#                 tiles: 10      9864100 permutations
#                 tiles: 11    108505111 permutations
#                 tiles: 12   1302061344 permutations
#             the number of possible words grows exponentially, at an expanding
#             rate that works to about 10x with each tile added within this range.
#             There is also an added dictionary size penalty, as we no longer
#             disallow longer words, but that increase will diminish as we grow. A
#             10-chit hand takes about 30 seconds on my machine. Good thing we
#             used an XS permutor. Of note adding letters doesn't really scale the
#             point values found, although I was able to find the word PAMPHREY
#             for 23 points on an 11-tile hand.
#
#             One notable thing that came to light during the output procedure is
#             that Algorithm::Permute under certain conditions changes its input
#             array in place, keeping the reference but removing the contents of
#             the array. It only does this when the output length is equal to the
#             input length; apparently it uses a different algorithm in this
#             specific case than that for generating nPr where n > r. Consequently
#             the loop for 7 tiles from lengths 2..7 succeeds but looping
#             (reverse(2..7)) fails, because in the first case the $hand array
#             referance is still populated until after the last iteration, but in
#             the second is depopulated on first pass and subsequent calls to the
#             iterator->new method fail. In order to display the initial hand
#             after the premutation logic we need to previously have made a deep
#             copy of this initial array, by dereferencing, copying the array to a
#             new variable and then re-referencing that. This side effect does not
#             appear to be documented, but has been reported to the author.
#
#         example:
#             tiles:               [S] [U] [N] [E] [R] [P] [T]
#
#             best words found:
#                                  PUNSTER
#                                  PUNTERS
#
#             point score:         18
