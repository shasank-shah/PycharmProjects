#Where i, j, k â‰¥ 0
# also is a  5-smooth number as none of its prime factors is greater than 5
# for ex : 18 = 2^1 * 2^3 * 5^0 so it is a hamming number 
# but 42 equals  2^1 * 3^1 * 7^1
# so it's not a hamming number
# we simply check if it's a hamming number in the `is_hamming` fuc. by checking it's prime factors
