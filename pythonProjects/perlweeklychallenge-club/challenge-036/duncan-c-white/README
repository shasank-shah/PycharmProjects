Challenge 1: "Write a program to validate a given Vehicle Identification Number
  (VIN). For more information, please checkout
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number
"

My notes:  sounds rather tedious, lots of tables of codes, and optional
bits only enforced in some countries. Do we have to validate all the
optional bits?


Challenge 2: "Write a program to solve the Knapsack Problem.

There are 5 color coded boxes with varying weights and amounts in
GBP. Which boxes should be choosen to maximize the amount of money while
still keeping the overall weight under or equal to 15 kgs?

R: (weight = 1 kg, amount = £1)
B: (weight = 1 kg, amount = £2)
G: (weight = 2 kg, amount = £2)
Y: (weight = 12 kg, amount = £4)
P: (weight = 4 kg, amount = £10)

Bonus task, what if you were allowed to pick only 2 boxes or 3 boxes or
4 boxes? Find out which combination of boxes is the most optimal?
"

My notes: sounds interesting!
