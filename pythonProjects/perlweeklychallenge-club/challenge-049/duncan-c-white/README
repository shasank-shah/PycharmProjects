Task 1: "Smallest Multiple:

Write a script to accept a positive number as command line argument and print the smallest multiple of the given number consists of digits 0 and 1.

For example:
For given number 55, the smallest multiple is 110 consisting of digits 0 and 1.
"

My notes: cute.


Task #2: "LRU Cache

Write a script to demonstrate LRU Cache feature. It should support
operations get and set. Accept the capacity of the LRU Cache as command
line argument.

Definition of LRU: An access to an item is defined as a get or a set
operation of the item. "Least recently used" item is the one with the
oldest access time.

For example:

capacity = 3
set(1, 3)
set(2, 5)
set(3, 7)

Cache at this point:
[Least recently used] 1,2,3 [most recently used]

get(2)      # returns 5

Cache looks like now:
[Least recently used] 1,3,2 [most recently used]

get(1)      # returns 3

Cache looks like now:
[Least recently used] 3,2,1 [most recently used]

get(4)      # returns -1

Cache unchanged:
[Least recently used] 3,2,1 [most recently used]

set(4, 9)

Cache is full, so pushes out key = 3:
[Least recently used] 2,1,4 [most recently used]

get(3)      # returns -1
"

My notes: ok, so an array of keys in most-recently-used
order, and a hash to store the (no more than $capacity)
key, value pairs.
