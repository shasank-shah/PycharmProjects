Challenge 1: "Create a function to check divide by zero error without
	      checking if the denominator is zero."

My notes: so eval then?


Challenge 2: "Create a script to demonstrate creating dynamic variable
	      name, assign a value to the variable and finally print the
	      variable. The variable name is passed as a command line argument."

My notes: so eval again?
