# tw.weekly.c74


The Weekly Challenge - #074 - Tyler Wardhaugh

## Usage

Run the project directly (shows default output from both tasks):

    $ clojure -m tw.weekly.c74

Run the project's tests (which are samples from the task descriptions):

    $ clojure -A:test:runner

Run Task #1 with input:

    $ clojure -m tw.weekly.ch-1 8 8 8 7 9

Run Task #2 with input:

    $ clojure -m tw.weekly.ch-2 "asdjfklsfasdjfklq"

## Project Template

I used Sean Corfield's clj-new to generate the project template

    $ clj -A:new app tw.weekly.c74
